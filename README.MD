## Getting started
Please notice if you want to run application locally first of all you have to start the API server (atlassian-api folder).

This application uses localhost: 9000 as the REST server, so to run the current application we first need to enable REST server. Then we can execute the command `yarn start`.

Please be inform that detailed information about project configuration you can find in next folders.
